_Hello._<br>
My name is Ryan. Like many programmers, I have a diversity of hobbies/interests and plurality of influences. Chief among them: the Outdoors and writing songs on the acoustic guitar. Also, I employ long rambling wanders on my motorcycle for inspiration. I believe that while coding is important, equally as important is domain expertise. 
Thus I try to learn lots about the interesting world outside by travelling often and maintaining healthy curiosity about many things.
