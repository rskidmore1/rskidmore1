## I am a Full Stack Developer <h3>

_Hello._<br>
My name is Ryan. Like many programmers, I have diversity of hobbies/interests and plurality of influences. Chief amoung them: the Outdoors and writing songs on the acoustic guitar. Also, I employ long rambling wanders on my motorcycle for inspiration. 
I field any and all inqueries and return messages as quickly as I can. 
I believe that while coding is important. Equally as important is domain expertise. 
Thus I try to learn lots about the interesting world outside by travelling often and maintaining healthy curosity about many things. 

**I'm currently working on:**
  * Building projects in Node,js and React
  * Learning C
  * Improving my design skills with a short challenge every week
