_Hello._
My name is Ryan, in case you missed in the rest of my profile. 
I field any and all inqueries and return messages as quickly as I can. 
I believe that while coding is important. Equally as important is domain expertise. 
Thus I try to learn lots about the interesting world outside by travelling often and maintaining a diverse wheel house of hobbies. 

**I'm currently working on: **
  *Building projects in Node,js and React
  *Learning C
  *Finishing LearningFuze coding bootcamp
