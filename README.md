Hello. 
My name is Ryan, in case you missed in the rest of my profile. 
I field any and all inqueries and return messages as quickly as I can. 
I believe that while coding is important. Equally as important is domain expertise. 
Thus I try to learn lots about the interesting world outside by travelling often and maintaining a diverse wheel house of hobbies.
